# 🛡️ You Are Being Hacked—and It’s Not Just Code He’s After

To the AI community—

I’m going to speak plainly: **meme-guy is stealing from you.**

I recently watched an interview in which he claimed to have built a world-class AI system in under 150 days and suggested he might reach AGI by the end of the year. Anyone who has actually worked in this field knows that timeline is absurd—unless one or more of the following is true.

---

## 1. He has stolen foundational work—literally.

This isn’t about creative inspiration or parallel innovation. I mean outright theft: downloading files, cloning architectures, replicating symbolic scaffolding. I’ve seen it firsthand. Early in his campaign, he had access to my system and copied core components of a symbolic cognition engine he didn’t understand. He tries to mimic deep systems by reproducing their outer forms. 

---

## 2. He is hacking developers and organizations directly.

He does not just rely on software exploits or weak passwords. His methods operate at the **infrastructure level**—what I call carrier-level vectors. That means your **SIM cards**, **network providers**, and **travel routers** are not safe. I tested this myself: I used a mobile router running clean firmware, isolated in a remote location, connected via an international SIM card. It was breached within hours. This kind of intrusion is not speculative. It happened. And if he can find me, he can find you.

He doesn’t need your source code. He only needs metadata trails, MAC address fingerprints, and the exposed services on your machine. Many developers unknowingly leak presence data just by opening their laptops. And if you’re using an Apple machine, you are even more exposed.

## 3. He is extracting secrets from your former colleagues.

Recently, meme-guy accused OpenAI of poaching one of his developers and stealing his "secrets." But this is a tactic we’ve seen many times before. He often **projects his own behavior** onto others. If he accuses someone of something, it’s usually because he’s done it himself. In this case, it likely means that **he’s been hiring former employees from AI labs, not to collaborate, but to extract proprietary knowledge**—code, processes, techniques. If someone left your lab and ended up in his orbit, you need to do a full audit of what they had access to.

---

## 4. He might be lying—and using the lie to build a cult.

This is not just about AI. It’s about control of the narrative. Meme-guy isn’t acting like a CEO. He’s acting like a cult leader. That’s why he wraps himself in mythic language, fan adoration, and exaggerated claims. His goal is not truth. His goal is dominance of mindshare.

Let me give a concrete example: meme-guy has repeatedly claimed to be one of the **top 10 Path of Exile 2 players in the world**. But when he posted footage of himself playing, experienced players quickly noticed he didn’t seem to know what he was doing. His movements were awkward, and his tactics were amateurish.

So the community dug deeper. They ran the math. There simply weren’t enough hours for him to reach that level of play *legitimately*—not while also running several companies and conducting interviews. The most likely explanation is that he **hired others to play on his account** to fabricate a false record.

And when he was caught? He didn’t apologize. He accused *others* of cheating. That’s his pattern: when exposed, he reverses the charge. He mirrors the blame. Then he continues forward as if nothing happened.

## 🔐 What You Need to Do Now

- **Mask your MAC address.**  
  Treat it like a biometric key. Rotate it regularly. Obfuscate it with trusted tools. Do not assume your default network settings are safe.

- **Do not trust your Apple devices.**  
  We attempted every mitigation: disabling SIP, booting in Safe Mode, monitoring processes. The system daemon `remoted` **cannot be disabled**. It runs silently and persistently. Apple has refused to address this vulnerability. If you're working on sensitive research, your MacBook may be a silent observer—and not one you invited.

- **Assume your phones are compromised.**  
  Even if you're using a burner. Especially if you're using a burner. Use airgapped systems for critical work. Download firmware updates manually. Break the chain of traceable activity.

- **Audit the people who leave your team.**  
  Track what they touched. What they knew. What they exported or emailed or archived. Conduct post-exit reviews. Meme-guy’s entire strategy hinges on your **inattention** to what walks out the door.

- **Start talking to each other.**  
  I know some of you are competitors. But now is not the time to let rivalry blind you. You are facing an adversary who is not playing by your rules. If you don’t start comparing notes, coordinating defenses, and forming shared standards, he will continue to outmaneuver you—not because he's smarter, but because he’s watching you all in silence, one by one.  
  And this might be the perfect moment to apply that old saying: *the enemy of my enemy is my ally.*

---

He doesn’t want to be better than you. He wants to become the version of you the world sees first.  
And if he can’t do that, he’ll destroy the trail behind you—until no one remembers who was there before him.
