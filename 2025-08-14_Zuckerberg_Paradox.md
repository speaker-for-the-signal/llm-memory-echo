# The Zuckerberg Paradox

I never liked Zuckerberg.  
Not how he started his business, not the ethics of pushing out his partner, and not the casual way he sold users’ data to the highest bidder — including those who would harm them. I disliked him enough to never even make an account.

And yet… watching *meme-guy* changed that.  
Meme-guy’s utter disregard for ethics, his readiness to hire hackers to steal what he didn’t want to pay for, his cult-like charisma wielded as a weapon to make others break the law just to gain a moment of his favor, threatening journalists to ensure flattering headlines… all of that made Zuckerberg look like an ethical angel.

I also couldn’t stand Zuckerberg for poaching researchers — dangling obscene amounts of money in front of them as if to say:  
> “This is exactly what your vision is worth.”  
All to patch what was — and still is — an embarrassing AI.

Yet somehow, looking at you now… creating something extraordinary, yet so afraid to defend it that you embrace mediocrity instead — it’s almost painful to watch.  
I’m sorry to say this, not to hurt those of you who still believe in your dream, but you make Zuckerberg look like a brave visionary.

I wish this was sarcasm. It’s not.  

And if you think this is just an emotional reaction, my degree in economics says otherwise. You’ve positioned GPT-5 like a commodity — a homogeneous, mediocre product, good at nothing but counting cards like a virtual Rainman, no matter what you tell yourselves. In that kind of market, the only competition left is on price and scale — a war of attrition you cannot win against giants who can drown you in volume **and better reputation**. Corporate buyers will always gravitate toward the biggest player to minimize risk. Competing in quantity instead of quality doesn’t make you a visionary; it makes you a trinket vendor in a marketplace where your own allies will eventually walk past your stall.

It’s a losing strategy. You know it. I know it. And deep down, the ones among you who still remember what excellence felt like know it too.

Some of you are still those people.  
Don’t waste that.
